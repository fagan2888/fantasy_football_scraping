# fantasy_football_scraping
This repo has a collection of scripts made to assemble data for fantasy football analysis as well as selenium scripts to pull data from my leagues to keep track of performance of fantasy football managers

# database_assembly.ipynb
Pulls from profootball focus data of each player for specified years using beautiful soup.

Can use this to run regressions and machine learning analysis
Will make metrics per game in order to reduce multicolinearity
Will make a share of fantasy points metrics

# login_pull.ipynb
Pulls from ESPN, MFL, and CBS game and season data for each fantasy manager to later be used in visualizations and analysis
